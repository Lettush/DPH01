    "1. Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use markdown headings and text to explain what you're analyzing (e.g., \"Total Orders\").\n",
    "    - Get the results of your calculations and write them down (e.g., \"Total Orders: 1000\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Category Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Create a table with headers \"Product Category\" and \"Average Order Value\".\n",
    "    - Fill the table with the average values of each category (e.g., \"Electronics: PHP 250\").\n",
